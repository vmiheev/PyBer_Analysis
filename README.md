* The following are the total monthly fares by city type:
![Chart](/analysis/PyBer_fare_summary.png)

The results show that Urban cities have the most total rides, total drivers and total fares, followed by Suburban and then Rural cities. However, Rural cities show the highest average fare per ride and average fare per driver, followed by Suburban and then Urban cities. Total fares for each week follow the summary data, with Urban cities generating the most revenue each week, followed by Suburban and Rural cities.

## Summary

Based on this data, the following recommendations can be made to address disparities:
* More effort should be given to advertising the service in Rural areas, as it has the lowest total rides and total drivers.
* Urban riders need to be targeted with more advertising to increase the average fare per driver, as the total urban rides are lower than the amount of total drivers
*
