# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of Project
Analyzing ride sharing data by city type to generate a data summary and look for links between various factors and revenue.

## Results

###Visualizations

* The following is a summary of ride sharing data by city type:

###Description

The results show that Urban cities have the most total rides, total drivers and total fares, followed by Suburban and then Rural cities. However, Rural cities show the highest average fare per ride and average fare per driver, followed by Suburban and then Urban cities. Total fares for each week follow the summary data, with Urban cities generating the most revenue each week, followed by Suburban and Rural cities.

## Summary

### Recommendations

Based on this data, the following recommendations can be made to address disparities:
* More effort should be given to advertising the service in Rural areas, as it has the lowest total rides and total drivers. This is an underserved market that could increase revenue.
* Urban riders need to be targeted with more advertising to increase the average fare per driver, as the total urban rides are lower than the amount of total drivers.
* Week-to-week revenue is stagnant; there needs to be more overall market presence so that weekly revenue is trending upward.
